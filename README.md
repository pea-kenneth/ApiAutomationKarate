Karate API Automation

Maven Parameterized command sample for "CreateUpdateDeleteUser" test

mvn clean test -Dkarate.options=classpath:API/FeatureFiles/ReqIN/CreateUpdateDeleteUser.feature -Dtest=ReqInRunner -Dkarate.env=req


Notes:
I didnt cover all endpoints but at least i cover all applicable methods from get, get with param, post, put and delete.
other endpoints that i did not cover is just basically the same with what i cover, the important thing is  i make sure to  cover all the requirements listed.
